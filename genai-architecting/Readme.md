## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.

The reason is due to concerns about the privacy of user data and the rising costs of managed services for GenAI.

They want to invest in an AI PC with an affordable spend of 10-15K USD.

They have 300 active students, and these students are located within the city of Dubai.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K USD.

We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet, and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students located within the city of Dubai.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern about copyrighted Arabic materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We're considering using IBM Granite because it's a truly open-source model with training data that is traceable, so we can avoid any copyright issues and ensure transparency in how the model works â€” especially for Arabic language processing.
